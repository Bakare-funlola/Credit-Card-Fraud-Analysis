# Credit-Card-Fraud-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyses a credit card transaction dataset to identify patterns and characteristics associated with fraudulent transactions. The analysis was conducted using Microsoft Excel, focusing on descriptive and exploratory data analysis techniques to uncover trends in transaction behaviour across different dimensions.

The objective of the project is to demonstrate how structured data cleaning, pivot table analysis, and visualisation can be used to support fraud detection and decision-making without relying on advanced predictive modelling.

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle  
- Dataset Name: Credit Card Fraud Transaction Data  
- Content: Transaction-level data including transaction amount, time, country, entry mode, transaction type, and fraud status.

---

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel  
- Pivot Tables  
- Charts and Visualisations  
- Excel Dashboard

---

## Data Cleaning Process
The dataset was cleaned prior to analysis to ensure accuracy and consistency. This included:
- Identifying and handling missing values
- Correcting incorrect data types
- Standardising categorical variables
- Ensuring numerical fields were properly formatted for calculations

---

## Analysis Approach
The analysis adopted a descriptive and exploratory approach. Pivot tables and charts were used to:
- Calculate the overall fraud rate
- Compare transaction amounts between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions
- Analyse fraud patterns by time of day
- Examine country-level distribution of fraudulent transactions
- Assess the financial impact of fraud based on transaction amounts
- Explore associations between transaction characteristics and fraud occurrence

Regression analysis was not applied, as the focus of the project was on pattern identification rather than prediction.

## Key Outputs
- Cleaned transaction dataset
- Pivot tables addressing key fraud-related questions
- Visual charts for comparative analysis
- Interactive Excel dashboard
- Observation and summary sheets documenting insights

---

## Findings Summary
The analysis shows that fraudulent transactions, although fewer in number, have a significant financial impact. Fraud occurrence varies by transaction amount, time, entry mode, and country, indicating that fraud risk is not evenly distributed across all transactions.

---

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis, it is recommended that financial institutions enhance monitoring during high-risk time periods, apply additional controls to high-risk transaction types and entry modes, and strengthen country-based risk checks. Regular descriptive analysis should be conducted to continuously update fraud detection strategies.
